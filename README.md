# 🎭 Facial_Expression_Recognition
**Real-time Facial Expression Recognition using CNN**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time facial expression recognition system** using
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Computer Vision** techniques.
The system detects human faces from live webcam input and classifies facial
expressions into predefined emotion categories.

The trained deep learning model is integrated with **OpenCV** to perform
real-time emotion prediction.
